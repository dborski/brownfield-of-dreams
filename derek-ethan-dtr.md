# DTR - Derek, Ethan

### Project: Brownfield of Dreams


#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Ethan - Wants to get further along this time, hopefully finish. Wants to get more comfortable with ActiveRecord

Derek - I'd love to finish the project and get to the extensions if we have time. Like to get my feet wet in API's and get a good understanding of how to consume them.


#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Ethan - Been through mod 3 before so has some experience there. Debugging is a strength.

Derek - Good communicator. Brings some decent technical skills to the table and ActiveRecord is a strength.


#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

If we write code that isn't working, Ethan excels at and enjoys debugging. Both of us seem to work better independently, so we have no problem getting away from a pairing session and trying to work on our own.


#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

Ethan - Pretty available. Likes to keep lunch to himself. If we are ahead on project, wouldn't mind a little weekend time to himself. 10PM usually cutoff time.

Derek - Very available. I take dinners at 6 usually but can be flexible. Definitely down to work on weekends, but if I can have a little free time on weekends would be nice. Usually work till 10-11PM



#### Communication Expectations (How and how often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Both of us would like to do daily standups, times TBD.

We will try to communicate our statuses to each other if we won't be available or in front of the computer. 


#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Ethan - Would like to get a better understanding on the architecture of a code-base and the bigger picture.

Derek - Learn how to work with an existing code base. Learn APIs and more of the advanced features of Rails. Get a solid understanding of the learning goals 

#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

We would both like to at least work partially on most of the important features of the project. 

It's nice to have a 50-50 balance, but not totally necessary.


#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

We would like to use a PR template. PRs should be discussed before merging. If someone opens up a PR, it should be closed by EOD or sooner. 

Other teammate has at least one comment on every PR. 

Commit messages are mostly individual, but PRs should be more templated


#### Pomodoro Break Schedule:

Ethan - Follows strict pomodoro schedule

Derek - Wants to get better at taking poms. Definitely down to take regular poms


#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Ethan - Is totally fine with receiving constructive feedback. Ethan would like more of a why his partner did things rather than just how.

Derek - Would love to hear any constructive feedback. If there is something at the beginning or during the project that needs to be pointed out about me, please let me know sooner



#### Additional Remote Considerations:

Derek - Don't love super long pairing sessions. Pretty ok with working remotely in general though

Ethan - Remote work isn't his strength, but he's adapted to it.


#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

Github projects


#### Day 1 Agenda:

Finish first three cards
Brainstorm
Spend some time individually to get head wrapped around project
Install correct ruby and rails versions
